In order to perform, Nightly and Release pipelines need to call some deploy and promote jobs for runtimes, examples, images and operator.  
Those jobs should be present at the same level as the nightly and/or release job, so they can be found when called.

Here is the list of jobs and link to Jenkinsfiles:

* [kogito-runtimes-deploy](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.deploy)
* [kogito-runtimes-promote](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.promote)
* [optaplanner-deploy](https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.deploy)
* [optaplanner-promote](https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.promote)
* [kogito-examples-deploy](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.deploy)
* [kogito-examples-promote](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.promote)
* [kogito-images-deploy](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-images/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.deploy)
* [kogito-images-promote](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-images/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.promote)
* [kogito-operator-deploy](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-cloud-operator/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.deploy)
* [kogito-operator-promote](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-cloud-operator/blob/master/Jenkinsfile.promote)

## Nightly pipeline

### Nightly pipeline Architecture

The Nightly Pipeline is composed of many steps, calling different other jobs to perform the build&test of runtimes/examples/images/operator as well as the deployment of jar artifacts and nightly container images.

**NOTE:** The Nightly Pipeline is a multibranch pipeline job and runs on `master` and each active release branch (for example 0.15.x).

![Flow](./images/nightly-flow.png)

Steps could be separated into 2 parts:

* **Build & Deploy**  
  Composed of calls to `*-deploy` jobs, is reponsible to runtimes, examples, images and operator are ok.  
  Note that if any problem happens in a `deploy` job, then other deploy jobs are still run (they will take the previous stable artifacts/images) to run.
* **Promote**  
  Composed of calls to `*-promote` jobs, is responsible to deploy snapshots artifacts/nightly images to repositories/registries.

Note that for a particular part of the project (runtimes, examples, images or operator), if the `Build & Deploy` failed, then the `Promote` part is skipped.

### Activate/Deactivate release branch

Once a branch is created or another one should be deactivated, you just need to go the configuration of the [nightly job](https://rhba-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/job/KIE/job/kogito/job/kogito-nightly/configure) and change the `include` or `exclude` configuration of Git.

*TIP: just mention the branches you need in `include` part and leave the `exclude` part empty.*

### Nightly pipeline Parameters

If needed, the Nightly pipeline can be restarted with `SKIP_TESTS` or `SKIP` specific part options.  
See the [Nightly Jenkinsfile](../Jenkinsfile.nightly) for more information on parameters.

### Nightly pipeline Troubleshooting

Here are some information in case the Nightly pipeline fails ...

In the Zulip kogito-ci stream, there should be a link to the failing job. Open it and then open the `Blue Ocean` view. This will be easier to detect what is failing.

#### Nightly pipeline is failing

In case the main pipeline is failing, this will be most likely a Groovy error.  
This can happen when changes have been made to the [Nightly Jenkinsfile](../Jenkinsfile.nightly).

The problem will need to be corrected on the corresponding branch and the pipeline could be restarted.

#### Nightly pipeline is unstable

This usually means that one or many of the called jobs is/are failing. List of unsuccessful jobs should be displayed into Zulip and can be reviewed into the Blue Ocean.

By clicking the failing stage and accessing the failing job, you should be able to review the problem.

#### Nightly Build & Deploy job is failing

In that case, identify the error (Groovy script error or test problem), correct it and relaunch the Nightly Pipeline if necessary.

Here are some problems which can occur on a `Build & Deploy` job:

* Groovy script error (Jenkinsfile.deploy has some problems)
* Compilation
* Test errors
* Deployment problem (credentials)

#### Nightly Promote job is failing

In that case, identify the error (Groovy script error or test problem), correct it and rebuild the failing job.

Here are some problems which can occur on a `Promote` job:

* Groovy script error (Jenkinsfile.deploy has some problems)
* Deployment problem (credentials)

### Testing the Nightly Pipeline

In order to test the full Nightly Pipeline, and in order to avoid any problem, you will need to change some env in [Jenkinsfile.nightly](../Jenkinsfile.nightly), create jobs in Jenkins and setup some credentials.

* Have a specific container registry and credentials registered with `push` rights on it
* Have a specific Maven repository to deploy jar artifacts
* Create your own seed job which will create all the needed other jobs for you

#### Create specific Maven repository for nightly testing

For deploying runtimes and examples artifacts, and to avoid any conflict with main repository on snapshot artifacts, you will need to provide a nexus repository to deploy the artifacts.

If don't have one already, you can create one with the [nexus-operator](https://github.com/m88i/nexus-operator).

**IMPORTANT:** We don't support yet specific user's credentials. Anonymous user needs to have push rights to it.

#### Create the different Jenkins jobs for nightly testing

See [Jenkins documentation](./jenkins.md) to create the different jobs for the testing and adapt the configuration with correct `maven.artifacts_repository` and `cloud.*` properties.

**IMPORTANT: The different credentials IDs you are setting into the configuration should be available in Jenkins/Credentials.**

#### Launch a nightly with minimal parameters for nightly testing

Just Build with default parameters.

* (optional) `SKIP_TESTS` (usually you will want that)
* (optional) `SKIP_*` to skip different phases

**NOTE:** Deploy & Promote jobs of a specific repository can be ignored (and so job does not need to be created for testing), but you will need to check the corresponding `SKIP_` parameter.

## Release pipeline

### Prepare the release branch(es)

In the Kogito release folder on Jenkins, you should find 2 jobs:

* **[Create release branches](../Jenkinsfile.release.create-branches)**  
  Based on the given version and repositories, a new release branch (with `Major.minor.x`) is created if not already existing on given repositories.
* **[Prepare Release](../Jenkinsfile.release.prepare)**  
  Prepare the GH/Jenkins environment for a release.  
  This should create the different release branches for the whole projects as well as updating the seed configuration to be able generate the new Jenkins job.

#### How to prepare a new release branch ?

You just need to call the **[Prepare Release](../Jenkinsfile.release.prepare)** job with the correct Kogito and Optaplanner versions.

This will create the release branches and will update the Jenkins seed configuration for generating the correct jobs.

After that, if the seed job (`0-seed-job`, at the root of the Jenkins folder) has not been launched automatically, you should start it.

Once the seed job has run, you should be able to see the new release branch in the Jenkins `release/{RELEASE_BRANCH}` folder. From there, you can start the release.

### Architecture of the Release pipeline

The Release Pipeline is composed of many steps, calling different other jobs to set the correct version, perform the build&test of runtimes/optaplanner/apps/examples/images/operator and then promote released artifacts and container images as production ready.

![Flow](./images/release-flow.png)

Like the Nightly Pipeline, steps could be separated into 2 parts: `Build & Deploy` and `Promote`.

The Release Pipeline is also adding extra functionalities to this:

* **Create PRs**  
  In the `Build & Deploy` phase, the different `Build & Deploy` jobs will create PR(s) with version changes on the release branch of the different repositories.
* **Merge PRs**  
  In the `Promote` phase, PRs create are merged by the different `Promote` jobs.
* **Set next snapshot**  
  For some of the repositories, it will also PR create&merge to update to the next "snapshot" on the release branch.

### Before the Release Pipeline is started

#### JIRA issues creation

Before starting the pipeline, please create the issues for the different components of the pipeline:

* Core
* Image
* Operator
* Optaplanner

**NOTE:** There is, for now, no automatic creation/update of JIRA issues into the pipeline. This has to be done manually...

### Where is the main release pipeline job

You can find the release pipeline job in `release/{RELEASE_BRANCH}/kogito-release`.

### Release pipeline parameters

#### Minimal parameters for the release

In order to start, here are the minimal parameters to the Release Pipeline:

* **PROJECT_VERSION**  
  Corresponds to the Kogito version to be set during the release.
* **OPTAPLANNER_VERSION**  
  Corresponds to the Optaplanner version to be set during the release (usually it is `Kogito Major + 7`)
* **DEPLOY_AS_LATEST**
  Should be set to true if we want the container images to be tagged as `latest`.

#### Start Release Pipeline with specific parameters

The Release pipeline can be tweaked with some other parameters if needed.

One option is the possibility to skip some stages, depending on which part you want to release.  
**NOTE: If you decide to skip the runtimes/examples part, please be careful on `EXAMPLES_URI` and `EXAMPLES_REF` parameters**

See [Release Jenkinsfile](../Jenkinsfile.release) for the full list on parameters.

### Release pipeline Manual interventions

#### Default manual interventions

One other specificity of the Release Pipeline are the manual interventions.  
They are currently 2 of them:

* **Release staging repository to Maven Central** (happens in main release pipeline)
  When asked, Staging repositories can be retrieved from [JBoss Nexus repository](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/). You need the rights to release the artifacts.  
  You should see some repositories named `kogito-public-XXX`. Select them all and click on `Release`.  
  Once artifacts are released, just confirm it on Jenkins.

#### Retry/Continue/Skip/Abort manual intervention

For each called jobs, in case of failure, there is retry/skip/abort manual intervention.

* **Retry**  
  Will completely relaunch the job, taking latest changes on the branch (test or groovy correction).
* **Continue**  
  Will ignore the failing result, store the job reference and continue the pipeline.  
  It can happen if you think the test failed because of random error but it is ok (can happen for BDD tests where trying again will pass the test, due to instability of Openshift ...).
* **Skip**  
  Will skip the current failing job and do not store any reference to it.  
  That means that if a deploy job fail, the corresponding promote job will not be executed.
* **Abort**  
  If any other problem.  
  As long as `promote` phase did not start, there will be no impact on the release.

### After the Release Pipeline is finished

Once the Release Pipeline is finished, there are some actions to be done:

#### Operator Crd/Csv files

Once the operator's release has been done, it created new csv and crd files under `deploy/olm-catalog/kogito-operator/{VERSION}` on the release branch in [kogito-cloud-operator](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-cloud-operator).
You will need to create, with those files, new OperatorHub PRs (one for Openshift and one for Kubernetes) or asked someone from Cloud part to do it.

If there is any change to be done due to PRs, do it on the release branch.

#### Docs release

Once pipeline is finished, you need to release docs. For that, please ask on Zulip for anybody with rights to do it.

#### Update the JIRAs

You can now close the different JIRA issues regarding the release.

#### Update master config jobs with new release branch

In case a new release branch has been created, you will need to update the seed job configuration to take that branch into account.  
And also, you may need to update the release branch dsl configuration.

First, **on release branch**, go to [branch configuration](../dsl/branch_config.yaml) and setup any specific configuration (for example the correct optaplanner branch).

Second, **on master branch**, go to [main configuration](../dsl/seed/config.yaml) and add the new release branch to `git.branches` array.

Once the second step is done and merged (please merge the first step before), new jobs will be generated accordingly and nightly/sonarcloud jobs should be activated.

### Release pipeline Troubleshooting

Here are some information in case the Nightly pipeline fails ...

In the Zulip kogito-ci stream, there should be a link to the failing job. Open it and then open the `Blue Ocean` view. This will be easier to detect what is failing.

#### Release pipeline is failing

In case the main pipeline is failing, this will be most likely a Groovy error.  
This can happen when changes have been made to the [Release Jenkinsfile](../Jenkinsfile.release).

The problem will need to be corrected on `master` and the pipeline could be restarted.

#### Release pipeline is reporting a called *-deploy job is failing

In that case, identify the error (Groovy script error or test problem), correct it and relaunch the Nightly pipeline if necessary.

If the problem is a test error, check the errors and then decide to retry or skip the called job (see [retry possibility](#retryskipabort-manual-intervention)).

If the problem in `Build & Deploy` job is one of those:

* Groovy script error (Jenkinsfile.deploy has some problems)
* Compilation error
* Create PR or deployment problem (credentials)

You can correct it, and then just retry the job (see [retry possibility](#retryskipabort-manual-intervention))

#### Release pipeline is reporting a called *-promote job is failing

In that case, identify the error (Groovy script error or test problem), correct it and rebuild the failing job.

Here are some problems which can occur on a `Promote` job:

* Groovy script error (Jenkinsfile.deploy has some problems)
* Merge PR (on set release version PR) or Deployment problem (credentials)

You can correct it, and then just retry the job (see [retry possibility](#retryskipabort-manual-intervention))

**WARNING:**  
**If the problem occurs during a `set next snapshot` stage, then you should not retry the job. If that happens, that means that "release" steps have been done. So just skip the job and set the next snapshot manually in the repository on the corresponding release branch**

### Testing the Release Pipeline

In order to test the full Release Pipeline, and in order to avoid any problem, you will need to create Jenkins jobs with sepcific environment and some credentials.

* Have a specific container registry and credentials registered with `push` rights on it
* Have a specific author repository that you can test against
* If you don't want to flood your test author repository with temporary branches, you should use also another author, referred as "bot account", and that you can setup in environment variables `BOT_*`
* Have a specific Maven repository to deploy jar artifacts
* Create all the required Jenkins jobs

#### Create specific Maven repository for release testing

For deploying runtimes/examples artifacts, and to avoid any conflict by creating a staging repository inadvertly, you will need to provide a nexus repository to deploy the artifacts.

If don't have one already, you can create one with the [nexus-operator](https://github.com/m88i/nexus-operator).

**IMPORTANT:** We don't support yet specific user's repository. Anonymous user needs to have push rights to it.

#### Create the different Jenkins jobs for release testing

See [Jenkins documentation](./jenkins.md) to create the different jobs for the testing and adapt the configuration with correct `maven.artifacts_repository` and `cloud.*` properties.

**IMPORTANT: The different credentials IDs you are setting into the configuration should be available in Jenkins/Credentials.**

**IMPORTANT:**

* When using `Optaplanner Promote` job, please also create a specific branch to be executed and comment the content of the `uploadDistribution` method.
* When deploying artifacts for runtimes/apps/examples/optaplanner, make sure the branch you deploy is up to date to avoid any conflict with current deployed artifacts !

#### Launch a release with minimal parameters for testing

* `PROJECT_VERSION`
* `OPTAPLANNER_VERSION`
* (optional) `SKIP_TESTS` (usually you will want that)
* (optional) `SKIP_*` to skip different phases

**NOTE:** Deploy & Promote jobs of a specific repository can be ignored (and so job does not need to be created for testing), but you will need to check the corresponding `SKIP_` parameter.

## Explanation on architecture of those pipelines

### Background & Objectives

The Kogito project is composed of 3 parts:

* Runtimes (kogito-runtimes, kogito-apps, kogito-examples)

  * Jar artifacts
  * Deployed to Maven repository

* Images (kogito-images)

  * Cekit (docker) build
  * Deployed to Quay

* Operator (kogito-cloud-operator)

  * Go / OperatorSDK
  * Deployed to Quay

The objectives are:

* Unify deployment process from runtimes to operator
* Avoid human interaction
* Reuse processes

### Problems / Solutions

#### Problems

* Need runtimes’ artifacts to test images & operator
* Different technologies (Java, Cekit/Docker, Go)
* High-level tests are done in BDD tests (operator)

#### Solution

* Main pipeline to control the flow
* Separate build&tests and promote
* Promote is done only when all tests in all repositories are ok
* Each “repo” keeps its own deployment/promote process

### Nightly pipeline Proposal

The [Nightly pipeline](../Jenkinsfile.nightly) for Kogito is responsible to build&test runtimes artifacts, images and operator.  
For that, it will call different jobs for deployment and then for promote if all tests passed.  

![Nightly pipeline](./images/pipeline-nightly.png)

If the pipeline is failing or is unstable, then a notification is sent to Zulip.

### Release pipeline Proposal

The [Release Pipeline](../Jenkinsfile.release) aims to enhance the Nightly Pipeline by providing added features like `set version`, `create/merge PRs`, `git tag`...

![Release pipeline](./images/pipeline-release.png)

Some steps are still manual (like jar artifacts promotion to Maven Central) and notifications are sent to Zulip for manual intervention.
